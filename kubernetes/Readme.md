Â # Prove of concept for ambari on kubernetes

I was interested in if it is generally possible to run ambari on top of kubernetes.
If this is a good idea  is a separate discussion, I just wanted to see if it is
teoretically Possible.

## Installing

run:
```
  kubectl creat -f kubernetes/ in the root folder of this Project
```

this brings up a cluster with 1 ambari server and 5 ambari agent nodes.

```
kubectl get pods --namespace=ambari
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amb-agent-btj80       1/1       Running   0          13h
amb-agent-cn5qe       1/1       Running   0          13h
amb-agent-fwfre       1/1       Running   0          13h
amb-agent-sk80u       1/1       Running   0          13h
amb-agent-uxaec       1/1       Running   0          13h
ambari-server-leqn7   1/1       Running   0          13h
```

get a terminal in the master node:

```
kubectl exec -ti --namespace=ambari /bin/bash
```

and paste

```
export BLUEPRINT=multi-node-hdfs-yarn
export EXPECTED_HOST_COUNT=5
/tmp/install-cluster.sh
```

### Acces the ambari web interface

In order to access the web interface you have to modify the file ambari-web-service-sc.yml
to provice an external loadbalancer / url to acces according to your kubernetes cluster.


## Issues

I had to modify the setting dfs.namenode.datanode.registration.ip-hostname-check to false in hdfs-site.xml.
I Used the ambari web ui for doing this, and restarted the affected servies.
Without this the datanodes where not starting.

It would be nice if I could use the ambari shell to set this property befor starting the cluster.

Next issue is that there are a lot of other extarnal services / web uis running
on different nodes in the cluster which kubernetes is not aware of. So I could
not use the kubernetes native means to expose them to the internet. One solution
might be to do a port mapping for every possible service port on every agent pod,
but to do so I need a list of the possible ports that have to be accessable from
the internet.

## TODO

* provide something similar to docker functions in ambari-functions for kubernetes
* find a solution for exposing the different web interfaces exposed by services in the cluster.
